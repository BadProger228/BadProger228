# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm a Software Engineering Student from KPI

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently studying **Software Engineering** at **Kyiv Polytechnic Institute**. Iâ€™m passionate about creating smart, functional applications and experimenting with new technologies. While my GitHub activity may be irregular, it's because I mainly use it as a platform to showcase the best of my work.

## ðŸš€ I'm looking for a position as a **C# Back-End Developer**

I love solving technical challenges and building robust systems. Most of my projects focus on desktop applications, data processing, and practical tools that are actually usable. I try to write clean, maintainable code and enjoy learning better ways to structure and optimize my applications.
